Skincare Ecommerce Website with PHP &amp; Admin Panel

The Phrase – Skincare Product Landing Page with PHP & Admin Panel
The Phrase is a dynamic and responsive skincare product landing page that I originally created as a static front-end project. In this upgraded version, I’ve integrated backend functionality using PHP and MySQL to make it fully functional for real-world use.

Key Features:
Beautifully designed product landing page for skincare products

Add to Cart functionality with dynamic product display

A cart summary section appears at the bottom after adding a product

Total pricing and selected products shown during checkout

User fills a checkout form and the submitted data is stored in the database

Admin Panel included to view all submitted user details

Previous version only sent form details via email — now upgraded to full backend handling

Tech Stack Used:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL

Form Handling: PHP form validation and storage

Admin Panel: Custom-built with PHP for viewing user submissions

Note:
This project showcases both my frontend and backend development skills and reflects the transition from a static webpage to a fully functional ecommerce-ready site.
